## Quartz.NET 3.1

This release concentrates on performance and bringing support to de facto Microsoft libraries like dependency injection and ASP.NET Core hosting. A big change is that now SQL queries use parametrized scheduler name, which allows database server to reuse query plans and use indexes more optimally. This will help especially clusters which have large number of nodes. The SQL server indexes were also revisited and their amount reduced by using smarter covering indexes.

There is also a very important bug fix present for lock handling on retries. There was a possibility for a deadlock in database lock handling in some situations.
